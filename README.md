# DepressedBot

Original V1 Java source is not available and **never** will be (mostly because it's garbage).

Feel free to run this bot in your own guilds. Be aware that most all of the IDs are hard-coded and will require changing.

Any change you make you are responsible for. I will not provide support for this bot like I do with [Volte](https://github.com/Ultz/Volte), as Volte is my main, general-use bot and this one is **specifically for one Discord guild**.
I will also not be making releases. The bot will basically stay at V2.0.0.0 until V3 is released, if I ever release another version.

Despite this, you can run this for yourself and have fun. Just be aware that ***you're on your own***.
